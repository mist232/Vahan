Use http://universities.hipolabs.com/search API to get this list and show university name, country and website, in each row. Website field should be a clickable link which should open an in-app webview when clicked. Also write a service which will keep refreshing data from the API every 10 seconds. It should refresh the list even if I minimise the app or exit it
